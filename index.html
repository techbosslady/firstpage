    Hey! It's Monique.  My friends call me MoJo.  I am a technical trainer.  
	Usually, I am working in the hardware field, teaching people how to build, fix and troubleshoot computers.  
	I am REALLY interested in learning how to code so that I can teach other people how to do it.  
	I think that coding is a very GREAT field in IT because of the flexibility of work schedule that it provides.  
	</p>
	<p>
	Most of the information that I know about computers was self taught.  
	I started with learning Microsoft Office and then branched out from there.  
	My motto is "If you can read it, hear it or view it, you can KNOW it, like MoJoKnowz!
	
	I am super excited about the thought of teaching for Per Scholas.  In  this video, you can see where I planted the seed about teaching people about computers during an interview with the Arthur Blank Foundation.
